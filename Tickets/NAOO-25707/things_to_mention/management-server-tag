management:
  server:
    add-application-context-header: false

I did not change this server tag as it looks to be in a different context!

That being said just pushing the changes to the root level server tags has the advantage of probably
not breaking anything, and if need be it can be added here and then checked for validity separately

Problem is i am not sure what that management tag is doing or if it is a separate server attirbute
I imagine it probably is.

Affected services:
inventory-service
mygfs-customer-service
